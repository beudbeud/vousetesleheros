You remember the age of the Gamebooks? If not, it's that you are too young.

Gamebooks were books that were allowing the reader to participate in the story
by making choices. They were usually set in a Heroic Fantasy / Fiction world,
and the reader / player had to solve puzzles, (virtually) fight dragons with
his/her weapons of choice: dices.

Anyway. Multiple choices, leading to another "room" and then other choices, leading
to other dangerous situations, etc... that's a bit like hypermedia books, if you
think about it.

That's the reason why, for a conference, we (Pablo Pernot and Bruno Bord) decided
to build a website that would allow players to make their own choices in an "adventure".
The adventure being... building a website.

Anyway. We were using a tiny rendering engine, that "groks" YAML files and renders
them in a set of hyperlinked webpages.

This is the documentation of this tool... “Vous êtes le héros”.
